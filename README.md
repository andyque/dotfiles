I use Vundle to management my vim plugins. You can refer to this link for more information: [Vundle]( https://github.com/gmarik/vundle )

# Install with:

    git clone https://github.com/andyque/dotvim.git ~/.vim

    cd ~/.vim

    ./install.sh
    
# Install plugins

Open a arbitrary file and run the following ex command of vim:

    :BundleInstall
    Note: The BundleInstal commands will not install YouCompleteMe on default, you should uncomment it from *bundles.vim*
    
 # Install oh-my-zsh, tmux
    sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
    brew install tmux
    brew install reattach-to-user-namespace
    ./rock.sh

## Config YouCompleteMe plugin

You can refer to [this link](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe) for more information.

# Tips:
    If you want to use the full power of these vim plugins, you should install python,ruby ctags,jsctags.

# For Windows Platform
